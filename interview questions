<h1>What is Cypress?</h1>

Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that doesn't use Selenium at all. It is built on top of Mocha, 
which is again a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and in the browser, 
making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Cypress also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library for node.js
and a browser that can be paired with any JavaScript testing framework.
Additionaly, Cypress consists of a free, open source, locally installed Test Runner which is focused on developers and QA engineers.
Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

<ul>
<li>End-to-end tests</li>
<li>Integration tests</li>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.</li>
</ul>
